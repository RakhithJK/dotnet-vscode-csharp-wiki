## 1.4.1 (September 1, 2016)

* This addresses an issue found and fixed by @sixpindin in which the legacy csharp.omnisharp and csharp.omnisharpUsesMono settings are no longer respected. These settings have been supplanted by the omnisharp.path and omnisharp.useMono settings but are still expected to work if specified.

## 1.4.0 (August 29, 2016)

#### Metadata as Source

* Go to Definition (<kbd>F12</kbd>) can now show a C#-like view for APIs that do not appear in your project's source code. ([#165](https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-vscode/issues/165))

#### Debugger

* Applications can now be launched without attaching the debugger with <kbd>Ctrl+F5</kbd>.
* Support for new "embedded portable PDB" debug format.
* The launch.json file generator now automatically sets the option to show a console window by default (`"internalConsoleOptions": "openOnSessionStart"`).

#### New Settings

Several new settings have been added:

* `csharp.suppressDotnetInstallWarning`: Suppress the warning that the .NET CLI is not on the path.
* `omnisharp.autoStart`: Used to control whether the OmniSharp server will be automatically launched when a folder containing a project or solution is opened. The default value for this setting is `true`.
* `omnisharp.path`: Can be used to specify a file path to a different OmniSharp server than the one that will be used by default. Previously, this option was controlled by `csharp.omnisharp`, which is now deprecated.
* `omnisharp.useMono`: When `omnisharp.path` is specified, this controls whether OmniSharp will be launched with Mono or not. Previously, this option was controlled by `csharp.omnisharpUsesMono`, wich is now deprecated.
* `omnisharp.loggingLevel`: Used to control the level of logging output from the OmniSharp server. Legal values are `"default"` or `"verbose"`.

#### Colorizer

There have been several fixes to the colorizer grammar resulting in much smoother syntax highlighting, with better support for C# 6.0. Special thanks go to [@ivanz](https://github.com/ivanz) and [@seraku24](https://github.com/seraku24) for contributing most of the fixes below!

* Expression-bodied members ([#638](https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-vscode/issues/638), [#403](https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-vscode/issues/403), [#679](https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-vscode/issues/679), [#249](https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-vscode/issues/249))
* Escaped keyword identifiers ([#614](https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-vscode/issues/614))
* Using directives and nested namespaces ([#282](https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-vscode/issues/282), [#381](https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-vscode/issues/381))
* Field and local variable type names ([#717](https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-vscode/issues/717), [#719](https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-vscode/issues/719))
* Multi-dimensional arrays in parameters ([#657](https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-vscode/issues/657))

#### Performance

* Improvements have been made in processing diagnostics (i.e. errors and warnings).
* Full solution diagnostics are no longer computed for large solutions (e.g. solutions with >1000 files across all projects). However, diagnostics are still computed for open files.

#### Other Improvements

* Multibyte characters are now properly encoded, resulting in proper display in tooltips and fixing crashes in the OmniSharp server. ([#4](https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-vscode/4), [#140](https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-vscode/140), [#427](https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-vscode/427))
* Will no longer attempt to install a CoreCLR flavor of OmniSharp on Ubuntu versions other than 14 and 16. ([#655](https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-vscode/issues/655))
* Opening a solution or csproj no longer results in '0 projects' displayed in the status bar. ([#723](https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-vscode/issues/723))

## 1.3.0 (July 20, 2016)

* Support for Unity and Mono development on macOS and Linux has been restored! This release brings back support for the Mono version of OmniSharp, which is used to provide *much* better support for .csproj/.sln projects. Please note that Mono version 4.0.1 or newer is required.
* Generation of tasks.json and launch.json files can now properly handle nested projects. [#170](https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-vscode/issues/170)
* New UI that makes it easy to select a process ID when attaching the debugger to another process. Note: If you have an existing launch.json file, you can re-generate it by deleting the file, closing your workspace in Visual Studio Code and opening it again. Or, you can open the launch.json file and change the `processId` value to `"${command.pickProcess}"`.
* Support for debugging in .cshtml files. To enable this, add a `sourceFileMap` entry to your launch.json with the following content: `"sourceFileMap": { "/Views": "${workspaceRoot}/Views" }`
* Support for conditional breakpoints
* New support for changing variable values in the debugger! To try this, just right-click on the variable name and select 'Set Value'. Note: To properly support this feature, we've changed the display of variable type names in the debugger to a shortened form. The full type name can be viewed by hovering over the name with the mouse.
* New configuration option to enable [stepping into properties and operators](https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-vscode/blob/release/debugger.md#stepping-into-properties-and-operators).
* Duplicate warnings and errors should no longer accumulate in Unity projects [#447](https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-vscode/issues/447)

## 1.2.0 (June 29, 2016)

* Adds debugger support for new Linux versions: Ubuntu 16.04, Fedora 23, openSUSE 13.2, and Oracle Linux 7.1
* Enhanced debug console output: module loads are now output, and there are launch.json options for controlling what is output
* Source file checksum support for breakpoints. This ensures that the debugger only sets breakpoints in code that exactly matches the open document.
* Support for editing the value of variables in the watch and locals window (requires VS Code 1.3)
