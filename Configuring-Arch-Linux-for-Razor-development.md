There is a packaging issue with Arch's `dotnet-sdk` package where the net46 Razor build tasks are missing from the Razor SDK. This file `/usr/share/dotnet/sdk/5.0.104/Sdks/Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Razor/tasks/net46/Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Razor.Tasks.dll` is missing from the [package file listing](https://archlinux.pkgs.org/rolling/archlinux-community-x86_64/dotnet-sdk-5.0.5.sdk202-1-x86_64.pkg.tar.zst.html). Projects build fine from the commandline when using `dotnet build`, because it looks for the net5 build tasks which are available. However, the C# extension relies on Mono to support .NET Full Framework projects and we require the Full Framework net46 build tasks which are missing.

This comment provides a work around https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-vscode/issues/4360#issuecomment-801181468 or you can try installing the `dotnet-sdk-bin` package which has the necessary file (see https://archlinux.pkgs.org/rolling/chaotic-aur-x86_64/dotnet-sdk-bin-5.0.3.sdk200-1-x86_64.pkg.tar.zst.html).
